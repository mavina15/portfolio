						<p>For an introduction workshop, this was hosted and demonstrated effectively, with many underrepresented students showing visible excitement and focus. This workshop gave me the confidence and initial interest to analyze sports data and apply my previous skillset to adding usability and application developments in future work. In the coming weeks, I intend to build a dashboard for this dataset that allows users to choose teams to pit against each other and predict the outcome of a game. This project would allows me to build my web application skills with the technologies of Flask.
